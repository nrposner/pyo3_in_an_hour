This challeges folder looks like it's actually filling up with general guidance, not challenges

rename the folder and create an actual challenges folder elsewhere. 

Maybe I should structure this more as a live workshop, with all the material we don't get through as extras, interactive and character-driven


the fax capability should come later on: it requires a lot more thinking about how to interact with Python objects from Rust, using Py<> for mutability, etc
