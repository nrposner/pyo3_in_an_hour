Welcome back.

You are a senior software engineer in Dunder Mifflin's Data Analytics and Paper Shredding Department. You're the product owner on the company's top new product: the DM-30000-MAX Combination Fax Machine and Paper Shredder... now with AI! This innovative, time-saving device will put Dunder Mifflin back on the map... there's just one problem.

You've just come back from vacation to find that there's been a mixup with the consultants that wrote the firmware: they wrote it all in Rust... but your engineers only know Python! The consultants have absconded and deadlines loom, leaving just one option: write a Rust-Python interface.
